## Concept
“Beehive” : a work that integrates science, art and technology through a staging that involves aerial and contemporary dance in constant interaction with technological elements such as videomapping, drones, sound art, light design, scenography and costume design, making a suggestive parallel between life of bees and the life of humans, the product of previous scientific and sociological research that adds up to a documentary tone.
