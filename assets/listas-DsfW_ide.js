Directed by Marc Caellas, written by Julio Wallowits  
Festival Iberoamericano de Teatro de Bogotá  
Colombia, 2012

## Concept

The whole world is full of artists.  
A writer and a Dj read lists of the remaining food in their cupboard while they face starvation.  
The milkman became a photographer, the butcher a film director, the baker an actor.  
There’s only a farmer and his harvest left, will he fall into the main stream artist life?
