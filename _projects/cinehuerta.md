## Info
Video for La Cinehuerta

## Concept
La Cinehuerta (film-garden) is a project founded by members of Casa B, a Bogotá based social and community project, a space for mediation and cultural creation in the Belén neighborhood, intending to build a solid cultural base through experimentation in the field of community development.  
A space for education, art workshops, film, and urban agriculture.

## Process
This video was the result of months of audiovisual workshops with kids from the neighborhood, they learned some technical aspects of the audiovisual world but overall they learned to tell their own stories.  
The space itself served as a perfect film studio for their stories, the beautifully corroded walls turned into an arid background for a spaghetti western, the gardens were converted in a cemetery where a little girl was surprised by zombies while leaving flowers on each grave.  
A ship breaking in half by an iceberg, its survivors floating on the ocean and later attacked by an enormous white shark.  
This stories which belong to our popular imaginary were used to invite a community and a city to take part in this project.
