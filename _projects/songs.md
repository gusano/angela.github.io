INFO

{:.text}
Live concert and release of the album by composer Santiago Lozano, based on the album’s graphic design by Sebastián Bravo, Bogotá 2008.  
<br/>
The audience is invited to enter Tropea, a fantasy land from where our character, who missed the last boat which sailed away with his love inside, designs a flying mechanical device which will help him cross the ocean and reach his lover’s arms.  
<br/>
A mix of music and images, Songs for Silvia leads the spectators to enjoy a sensorial trip. The music made of acoustic and electronic sounds is played live by the composer Santiago Lozano, while the images created by the artist Sebastián Bravo are projected in a real time cinematographic experience. The musicians on stage are surrounded by a lighthouse, where the character lives and has his flying machine workshop. And three air balloons are suspended from above the audience almost at reachable distance, each with motor propellers and interior light which changes intensity along with the music. A concert full of images, memories of love and broken hearts.
