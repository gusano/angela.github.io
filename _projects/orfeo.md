The exercise we have done in this workshop is a dialog between a classical myth (Orpheus) and a modern myth (the murder of Sharon Tate, the famous actress and wife of the film director Roman Polanski, murdered in 1969); also a dialog between the fictional space-time of the real event, trough various scenic and audiovisual devices.  
The scenery is installed in the outer space (outside the theater) breaking the traditional setting, where we recreate the living room of the Polanski house in Cielodrive 10050, Hollywood, place where Tate was assassinated.  
There is a projection in real time on the theater stage where the audience can see what goes on the outside stage, while those outside can see the place of the event while listening to the music that is coming from the interior of the theater.  
Inside, the lead opera singers are dressed as Sharon Tate while performing Euridice and Orpheus is dressed as Roman Polanski.  
Another singer impersonates Susan Atkins, the woman who stabbed and killed Tate.  
The 50 persons chorus are dressed as Saint Quentin State prisoners (where Manson remains).  
On the outside stage, the crime scene, with the same characters personified by actors.  
This allows the audience to be in two places simultaneously, one real and one virtual, on and off the stage.
